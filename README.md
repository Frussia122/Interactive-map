<h1>Traveler</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project is a web application that provides various features related to location and navigation. Users can search for places, get routes based on streets, view route information, and switch between different types of routes (e.g., walking, driving). They can also choose the most convenient route, view all the found places, and interact with a place by navigating to it or getting a route to it. The application supports searching for places based on categories and includes user registration and authentication functionality.</p>
